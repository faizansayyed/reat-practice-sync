1. **build.sh**:
   - In the "Build Docker Image" phase, you're attempting to build the Docker image with `npm run-script build` 
   before the Docker build. This might cause issues as the Docker context is being changed to the parent directory and then back.
    It would be cleaner to build the application within the Docker context.
   
2. **helm-chart/templates/deployment.yaml**:
   - In the `image` field, there's an issue with double curly braces in the `.Values.appName` value and the label selector.
    Replace `{ { .Values.appName } }` with `{{ .Values.appName }}`.

3. **helm-chart/templates/ingress.yaml**:
   - The same issue exists with double curly braces in the host path and label selector.
    Replace `{ { .Values.appName } }` with `{{ .Values.appName }}`.

4. **helm-chart/templates/service.yaml**:
   - Similar to previous files, replace `{ { .Values.appName } }` with `{{ .Values.appName }}`.

5. **helm-chart/values.yaml**:
   - It seems you are missing the `namespace` key under the `spec` section of the `Service`. 
   Add `namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}`.

6. **Dockerfile**:
   - The base image used in the `production` stage is `node:19-alpine`, but Node.js 19 does not exist.
    The latest LTS version of Node.js is recommended, such as `node:14`. Update the base image accordingly.

7. **Dockerfile**:
   - In the `production` stage, the `CMD` is set to `["npm", "start"]`. 
   However, the provided Dockerfile doesn't include a start script. 
   You might need to update this based on how your application is structured.
